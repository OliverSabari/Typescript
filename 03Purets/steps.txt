 Below are the steps for setting up ts to real projects

 1) tsc --init to create config file 
 2) npm init -y => as we are going to work with npm packages
 3) install lite server for running the project 
 4) add start tag in package json so we can run project using "npm start"
 5) create two folders src and dist, in src ts file goes on and dist is the final output of js file which goes to production
 6) create index .html and link the script to dist/index.js file 
 7) while compiling ts file the output should go to dist folder, so open ts config and in outDir: give the destination folder where compiled js file goes in
